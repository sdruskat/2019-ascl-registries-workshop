# Day 2

- Carly (DOE)
    - Collects products from DOE funding
    - \~50k products/y
    - DOE Code on GitHub: <https://github.com/doecode>

- Tom - Caltech Research Data Repository
    - Minimal set of metadata gathered
    - Caltech DOI
    - Incenitivizes release cycle/good enough practices
    - CodeMeta for ingesting metadata
    - binder for virtual environments

- Alice - ASCL
    - Editors who look for software in research
    - Link checkers!
    - Doesn't exist for citation but tracks citation

## TODOs

- ASCL: new imp of CFF -> 1.1.0
- Overarching project for CodeMeta & CFF
- Find out what registries need via crosswalk (actual fields)
- Define `UNKNOWN` values for CFF
- OntoSoft.org as another source for PhD
- Check out clowder
- Limit scope of CFF to "really just citation"
- Check out doecode scraper for software metadata
- Check out Gen's iasge scraper software metadata
- de-RSE registry based on RSD/DOECODE/InvenioRDM? (As little hosted metadata as possible)
    - "Metadata is a pain to maintain"
- funding in CFF?
- VM-URL in CFF?
- Have a CodeMeta properties-like table overview of keys
- Resolve registries metadata in cffinit
- Zenodo communities in CFF?
